    Use Of Information Obtained by Edudigm
</h1>

<p>
    We may use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Edudigm. Edudigm may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Service. Generally, you may opt out
    of such emails, although Edudigm reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p>
    Profile information is used by Edudigm primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to other users. In some cases, other users may be able to supplement your profile, including by submitting comments.

<h1>
    Sharing Your Personally-Identifiable Information with Third Parties
</h1>

<p>
    Edudigm shares your personally-identifiable information only in limited circumstances where Edudigm believes such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, legally required or, permitted by you.
</p>

<h1>
    For example:
</h1>

<p>
    We may provide personally-identifiable information to service providers who help us bring you the Service, such as hosting the Service at a co-location facility or sending email updates. In connection with these operations, our service providers may have
    access to personally-identifiable information for use for a limited time. Where we utilize service providers for the processing of any of personally-identifiable information, we implement reasonable contractual protections limiting the use of that
    personally-identifiable information to the provision of services to Edudigm.
</p>
<p>
    We may be required to disclose personally-identifiable information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share account or other personally-identifiable information when
    we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the Edudigm name, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing personally-identifiable
    information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
</p>
<p>
    If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Edudigm business, or individual business units or assets owned by Edudigm that are related to the Service, were to change, your personally-identifiable information may be transferred to the new owner.
    In any such transfer of information, your personally-identifiable information would remain subject to this section.
